## ShortURL-Services-List
A semi-curated list of 700+ Short-URL services (i.e goo.gl, bit.ly, ow.ly et al), based upon the original work by Sam Bokai (2016). I've added a couple hundred entries. BUYER BEWARE - some of these domains have fallen into the hands of the unsavory and the uncouth and may not be safe for children or soft animals.

### Note
'A lot of the entries are deprecated.' So sayeth Sam. I will ebventually jettison the dead. I've added a couple of new files showing the current status of each of the listings : URL-Shorteners-Annotated.csv and Signs-of-the-Times.csv which is how they resolved (or didn't), as of the timestamp of the commit, give or take 15 minutes. I took a maddeningly loose approach to the use of the term NXDomain - not in the WHOIS? NXDomain. No A record or MX? NXDomain. NS missing? You guessed it ... I'll tighten that up, eventually, and make proper entries in the SOTT.csv  Sam noted "they are left in the list due to legacy-usage and completeness. You should filter them out programatically in your project". As I said, the dead will be buried. I'll also run a VirusTotal scan on them all so i can parse intentional evil from

I don't drink beer, but appreciate a good scotch at the drop of a hat, I don't know if I am doing this right, but I do know that a number of these domains are potentially malicious, so here's my license and caveat:
